# Glif

<!-- Glif art/branding -->

Glif is a Filecoin web wallet built with Next.js that allows you to:

- **send and receive** Filecoin with your Ledger device
- **create** test accounts to send small amounts of FIL
- **import** accounts with seed phrases and private keys (SECURITY NOTICE: this is unsecure and is for testing and sending small amounts. If you need to recover an account, do it offline.)

### Install

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you want to develop using the Ledger integration, follow these steps to get the Ledger app onto your device: **_(Note: only use Ledger devices meant for testing purposes)_**

1. Download the shell script for installing the app (here)[https://57-227919429-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/home/test/project/src/ledger/pkg/zxtool.sh].
2. Run the file: `zxtool.sh load`.
